# GeoFencer

This is a simple iOS app designed for people creating location-based content.

It lets you manually define geofences by tagging physical points in the real world that you're currently standing at, using your phone's GPS. As a user, you define a region by tagging its two corner points, and the app will generate a valid geofence in the format that CoreLocation's geofence service expects (a center point and radius). It also provides an easy export, so you can get that data into your own app.
